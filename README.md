# Python Programming Assignment

This repository contains my solutions to a series of Python programming problems completed in **Jupyter Notebook**.  
Each problem is solved in a separate code cell and explained clearly using **Markdown cells**.

## 📘 **Contents**

1. **Two Sum Problem** – Finds indices of two numbers that add up to a target value.  
2. **Palindrome Number** – Checks whether a given integer reads the same forwards and backwards.  
3. **Longest Common Prefix** – Finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings.  
4. **Roman to Integer** – Converts a Roman numeral string into its integer equivalent.  
5. **Square Root (Without Built-ins)** – Calculates integer square root using binary search.  
6. **Python Lists vs NumPy ndarrays** – Compares features and use-cases.  
7. **Creating DataFrames using Pandas** – Demonstrates creating DataFrames from dictionaries and lists.
